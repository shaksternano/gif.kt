/**
 * A class for encoding GIF files.
 * The dimensions of the created GIF are determined by the first frame written.
 * Subsequent frames will have the same dimensions as the first frame,
 * cropping or padding the frame to fit if necessary.
 * The encoder must be closed after use to ensure all data is written correctly.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * // Obtain a Path to write the GIF data to
 * val path: Path = ...
 * val sink = SystemFileSystem.sink(path).buffered()
 * val encoder = GifEncoder(sink)
 *
 * val argb: IntArray = ...
 * val width: Int = ...
 * val height: Int = ...
 * val duration: Duration = ...
 * encoder.writeFrame(argb, width, height, duration)
 *
 * encoder.close()
 * ```
 *
 * @param sink The [Sink] to write the GIF data to.
 *
 * @param colorDifferenceTolerance The tolerance for color difference used by [colorSimilarityChecker]
 * when performing transparency optimization. This optimization works by making pixels that are similar to
 * the pixel in the previous frame transparent, resulting in only pixels that are different being saved.
 * Higher values will result in a smaller file size at the cost of visual artifacts. This optimization
 * is most effective on animations with large static areas.
 *
 * The default value of 0 slightly reduces file size with no visual quality loss.
 *
 * A value of around 0.01 provides a good tradeoff between file size and quality.
 *
 * Set to -1 to disable transparency optimization.
 *
 * @param quantizedColorDifferenceTolerance The tolerance for color difference used by [colorSimilarityChecker]
 * when performing transparency optimization after quantization. This optimization works by making pixels
 * that are similar to the pixel in the previous frame transparent, resulting in only pixels that are different
 * being saved. Higher values will result in a smaller file size at the cost of visual artifacts. This
 * optimization is most effective on animations with large static areas.
 *
 * A value of around 0.02 provides a good tradeoff between file size and quality.
 *
 * Set to -1 to disable transparency optimization.
 *
 * @param loopCount The number of times the GIF should loop.
 *
 * Set to 0 for infinite looping.
 *
 * Set to -1 for no looping.
 *
 * @param maxColors The maximum number of colors in each frame.
 *
 * Must be between 1 and 256 inclusive.
 *
 * @param colorQuantizer The [ColorQuantizer] to use for reducing the number of colors in each frame to [maxColors].
 *
 * @param colorSimilarityChecker The [ColorSimilarityChecker] to use for determining if two frames are similar
 * enough to merge.
 *
 * @param comment An optional comment to include in the GIF comment block metadata.
 *
 * @param transparentAlphaThreshold The alpha threshold for a pixel to be considered transparent.
 * Pixels with an alpha value equal to or less than this value will be treated as fully transparent.
 *
 * Must be between 0 and 255 inclusive.
 *
 * @param alphaFill The solid RGB color to use for filling in pixels with partial alpha transparency,
 * as GIFs do not support partial transparency.
 *
 * Set to -1 to disable filling.
 *
 * @param cropTransparent Whether to crop the transparent pixels from the edges of each frame.
 * This can reduce the size of the GIF by a small amount.
 *
 * @param minimumFrameDurationCentiseconds The minimum duration for each frame in centiseconds.
 * Setting this to a value less than 2 can result in the GIF being played
 * slower than expected on some GIF viewers.
 *
 * Must be positive.
 *
 * @param onFrameWritten A callback that is invoked after each frame is written,
 * providing the number of frames written and the total duration of all the frames written so far.
 * This can be used to track progress or update a UI.
 *
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException If any of the parameters are invalid.
